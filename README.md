# Data Visualization and Analysis (Challenge #6 of FinTech Bootcamp)

In this challenge, I used visualizations to tell the story behind real estate data. I used bars, lines, and interactive map graphs to determine which neighborhoods are more desirable to buy or rent property.

## Technologies

[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) - For data structuring and analysis.

[dotnev](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) - For API credentials in environment variable.

[os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html) - For OS functionality to get API keys in .env

[hvplot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org) - For interactive visualizations

[plotly.express](https://plotly.com/python-api-reference/plotly.express.html) - For interactive visualizations

## Lessons Learned

1- Used the hvPlot and Plotly Express libraries to create visualizations that allow you to interact with and explore your data.

2- Visualized geospatial (that is, location-based) data by using Plotly Express and the Mapbox API.

3- Built professionally styled and formatted data visualizations that incorporate multiple plots and convey your insights to an audience.
